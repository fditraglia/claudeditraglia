*Last updated: February 2026*

This site respects your privacy. Here's what we collect and why.

## Analytics

This site uses [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com), an open-source, privacy-friendly analytics tool. GoatCounter does not use cookies, does not track you across sites, and does not collect personal information. It counts page views so we know which guides are useful and which need work.

GoatCounter is free for non-commercial use and its code is fully open source. No data is shared with third parties. You can read their [privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy) for details.

## Email Updates

If you sign up for email updates, we store your email address through [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email), a newsletter service based in the United States. We use it to send occasional updates when new tools or guides are added — typically a few times per year.

We do not share, sell, or use your email for any other purpose.
