# The Toolkit

**Claude Code setup, configuration, and downloadable skills. From "what is this?" to a working system.**

## Prerequisites

Before starting this path, you should:

1. **Have used a chatbot** (Claude.ai or ChatGPT) at least a few times
2. **Have a paid Anthropic account** (Claude Pro at minimum; Claude Max recommended for heavy use)
3. **Be comfortable with the idea of using a terminal** — you don't need experience, but you do need willingness

If you haven't used chatbots much yet, start with [The Essentials](../essentials/index.md) first.

## What You'll End Up With

After working through this path, you'll have:

- **Claude Code installed and authenticated** on your computer
- **A CLAUDE.md file** that tells Claude about your role, projects, and preferences
- **MCP integrations** connecting Claude to your email, calendar, and documents
- **A library of skills** (slash commands) that automate recurring tasks
- **A system that improves over time** as you add skills and refine your configuration

The whole setup takes a few hours spread over a couple of sessions. The time investment pays for itself within the first week of regular use.
