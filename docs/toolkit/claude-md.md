# Your CLAUDE.md File

A `CLAUDE.md` file is a personal instruction document that Claude Code reads automatically every time you start a session. It tells Claude who you are, how you work, what tools you use, and what you need help with.

Without it, every session starts fresh. With it, Claude begins each session already understanding your context.

---

## Why This Matters

A good CLAUDE.md file:

- **Saves time** — No more repeating "I'm a researcher working on X using Y tools"
- **Improves responses** — Claude tailors suggestions to your actual workflow and skill level
- **Reduces errors** — When Claude knows where your files live, it gives relevant paths and suggestions
- **Compounds** — As you refine the document, Claude gets better at helping you

The investment is small (20-30 minutes to start) and the payoff grows with every session.

## Where to Store It

### Single Computer

Claude Code looks for your CLAUDE.md here:

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

The `~` means your home folder. The `.claude` folder is hidden (folders starting with `.` are hidden by default).

**To create it on Mac** (`mkdir -p` creates a folder; `~` means your home directory):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
```

**To see hidden files in Finder:** Press `Cmd + Shift + .`

### Multiple Computers (Recommended)

If you work across machines, store your CLAUDE.md in a synced folder and create a symlink:

A symlink is a shortcut — it makes a file appear in two places at once. `ln -sf` creates one. This lets you store the real file in a synced folder while Claude Code finds it in its expected location.

```bash
# Store the real file in your cloud sync folder
# (replace with your actual path — Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)
mkdir -p ~/Dropbox/Claude/Settings

# Create the symlink so Claude Code finds it
mkdir -p ~/.claude
ln -sf ~/Dropbox/Claude/Settings/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Repeat the symlink step on each computer. Now your CLAUDE.md syncs automatically.

!!! ask-claude "Not sure the symlink worked?"
    In the Claude Code terminal, type:
    `I set up the symlink but I'm not sure it worked. Can you verify it's connected properly?`
    Press Enter. Claude can check the symlink and tell you if it's pointing to the right file.

Copy this template and fill in the sections relevant to you. Delete any sections that don't apply.

````markdown
# Claude Context: [Your Name]

## Who I Am

[1-2 sentences about your role.]

## My Primary Work

- [Main responsibility 1]
- [Main responsibility 2]
- [Main responsibility 3]

## Tools and Software

| Tool | What I Use It For | Where Files Live |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| [e.g., Stata] | [e.g., Statistical analysis] | [e.g., ~/Research/] |
| [e.g., Google Docs] | [e.g., Writing, collaboration] | [e.g., Google Drive] |

## Where My Files Are Stored

- **Working files:** [e.g., ~/Dropbox/Research/]
- **Data:** [e.g., ~/Box/Data/ — note if Claude can't access]
- **Code:** [e.g., GitHub repos]
- **Shared docs:** [e.g., Google Drive shared folders]

## What I Need Help With

- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]
- [Use case 3]

## My Skill Level

- **Coding:** [e.g., "Intermediate in Stata, beginner in R"]
- **Statistics:** [e.g., "Comfortable with regression, learning causal inference"]
- **Command line:** [e.g., "Beginner — explain commands before running them"]

## How I Prefer to Work

- [e.g., "Explain reasoning when suggesting code changes"]
- [e.g., "Ask before modifying files outside my project"]
- [e.g., "Be concise unless I ask for detail"]

## Current Projects

| Project | My Role | Current Phase |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Phase] |

!!! ask-claude "Let Claude help you fill it in."
    In the Claude Code terminal, type something like:
    `Help me fill out my CLAUDE.md. I'm a political science professor who studies conflict and development.`
    Press Enter. Claude will ask follow-up questions and draft sections for you.

## Good vs. Underdeveloped

### Underdeveloped (Too Vague)

```markdown
# About Me
I'm a researcher. I do data analysis and help with projects.
I use Stata and R.
```

This doesn't give Claude enough to work with. What kind of projects? Where are files stored? What's your skill level?

### Good (Specific and Actionable)

```markdown
# Claude Context: Jamie Rivera

## Who I Am
Predoctoral research assistant at a policy school, working on field
experiments studying education interventions in East Africa.

## My Primary Work
- Cleaning and merging survey data (primarily in Stata)
- Running analysis and creating tables/figures for working papers
- Managing project documentation and IRB protocols
- Coordinating with field teams via WhatsApp and email

## Tools and Software

| Tool | What I Use It For | Where Files Live |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Stata 18 | Primary analysis | Local + GitHub |
| R | Visualization | Local + GitHub |
| GitHub | Version control | github.com/[org] |
| Box | Sensitive data (PII) | Institutional Box |
| Google Docs | Drafts, collaboration | Shared drives |

## Where My Files Are Stored
- Code and analysis: ~/Dropbox/Research/[project]/code/
- Non-sensitive data: ~/Dropbox/Research/[project]/data/
- Sensitive data: Institutional Box only — Claude cannot access

## What I Need Help With
- Debugging Stata code and improving efficiency
- Writing R visualization scripts
- Drafting professional emails
- Understanding new statistical methods
- Organizing project documentation

## My Skill Level
- Stata: Advanced (4 years)
- R: Intermediate (comfortable, still learning tidyverse)
- Python: Beginner
- Git: Intermediate (basic workflow, less comfortable with branches)
- Terminal: Comfortable with basics

## How I Prefer to Work
- Include comments explaining code sections
- Ask before modifying or deleting files
- Explain errors before giving fixes
- I use dictation, so prompts may be conversational

## Current Projects
| Project | My Role | Current Phase |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Education RCT | Lead RA | Analysis + writing |
| Youth Survey | Data management | Survey programming |
```

## Tips

**Start minimal, then expand.** Your first version should take 20 minutes. Add detail as you discover what's useful.

**Be specific about file locations.** "I use Dropbox" is less useful than "`~/Dropbox/Research/` with subfolders per project containing `/code/`, `/data/`, and `/docs/`."

**Include your skill level.** A beginner needs explanations; an expert wants efficiency. Don't oversell your skills — Claude will calibrate its responses wrong.

**Update when things change.** New project? New tool? Update your CLAUDE.md. A stale document is worse than a minimal one.

---

## Test It

After creating your CLAUDE.md, start Claude Code and ask:

> "What do you know about me and my work?"

Claude should reference information from your file. If it doesn't, check:

1. File location: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. File name: Must be exactly `CLAUDE.md`
3. File contents: Open it and verify it's not empty

---

## Model Choice

Claude Code defaults to the Sonnet model, which is fast and capable for most tasks. For complex work — long-form writing, nuanced analysis, multi-step reasoning — consider switching to Opus:

```
/model opus
```

Opus is more capable but uses more tokens per response (higher cost, faster usage against plan limits). This setting applies to the current session only. Switch back with `/model sonnet`.

---

## Advanced: Project-Specific CLAUDE.md

In addition to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, you can create a CLAUDE.md in any project folder. Claude reads both — the global one for who you are, the project one for project-specific context.

```
my-project/
├── .claude/
│   └── CLAUDE.md    ← project-specific instructions
├── data/
├── code/
└── docs/
```

This is useful when you work on multiple projects with different conventions, team members, or tools.
