<div class="credibility-strip" markdown>
By [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com), political economist at UChicago Harris. In January 2026 I started building AI workflows with Claude Code. What seemed impossible then — inbox triage, meeting capture, proposal drafting, project dashboards, trip planning — is running today. Claude Blattman isn't real, but the tools are. I've never coded in my life, so if I can do this you can. Have a question, suggestion, or request? [Send Claude Blattman a note](mailto:claudeblattman+feedback@gmail.com?subject=Feedback).

## What Is This?

This site covers AI tools for knowledge work — from [chatbot prompting](essentials/index.md) to advanced automation with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), a terminal-based AI tool that can read your files, search your email, manage your calendar, and run custom workflows. The site documents how I built a working system and shares everything so you can do the same.

## Where to Start

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **:material-lightbulb-outline: New to AI Tools?** <span class="badge-teal">No Claude Code required</span>

    ---

    Start with the essentials: which chatbot to use, prompt engineering that works, hands-free dictation, and meeting transcription. No coding or terminal needed.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The Essentials](essentials/index.md)

-   **:material-rocket-launch-outline: Claude Code for Newbies**

    ---

    Set up Claude Code, configure your CLAUDE.md, connect your email and calendar, and install your first skills. Step-by-step for Mac and Windows.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Setup Guide](setup/index.md)

-   **:material-format-text: First Session Skills**

    ---

    Three skills that require nothing but Claude Code. No integrations needed. Format rough dictation into structured prompts. Stress-test any plan with expert critique. Capture session decisions automatically.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: First Session Skills](workflows/first-session-skills.md)

-   **:material-view-dashboard-outline: Project Management with Claude Code**

    ---

    A system for tracking complex projects across email, docs, meetings, and messaging. Each project gets a living dashboard with status, history, and next steps — maintained automatically from meeting transcripts and project documents.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Project Management Workflow](workflows/project-management.md)

-   **:material-email-check-outline: Executive Assistant**

    ---

    Email triage, morning briefings, calendar queries, and communication drafting. A set of skills that handle the daily overhead of managing a busy schedule and high-volume inbox.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Executive Assistant Workflow](toolkit/executive-assistant.md)

-   **:material-sync-circle: Continuous Improvement**

    ---

    Email yourself tips and discoveries from any device. Two skills curate them, then propose concrete changes to your CLAUDE.md, skills, and rules — so your system gets better every week.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The Tips Pipeline](system/continuous-improvement.md)

-   **:material-file-document-check-outline: Tax Season Case Study** <span class="badge-teal">New</span>

    ---

    A complete case study: using Claude Code to collect tax documents from email, compile deductions, and catch errors with a three-year review. What worked, what AI got wrong, and transferable patterns for any document-heavy workflow.
