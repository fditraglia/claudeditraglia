<div class="credibility-strip" markdown>
By [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com), political economist at UChicago Harris. In January 2026 I started building AI workflows with Claude Code. What seemed impossible then — inbox triage, meeting capture, proposal drafting, project dashboards, trip planning — is running today. Claude Blattman isn't real, but the tools are. I've never coded in my life, so if I can do this you can. Have a question, suggestion, or request? [Send Claude Blattman a note](mailto:claudeblattman+feedback@gmail.com?subject=Feedback).

## What Is This?

This site is a guide to getting real work done with AI — from everyday chatbot use to advanced automation. It starts with [the essentials](essentials/index.md): choosing a chatbot, writing better prompts, hands-free dictation, and meeting transcription. No installation needed.

From there it goes deeper into [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), a terminal-based AI tool that can read your files, search your email, manage your calendar, and run custom workflows — like having a smart assistant sitting at your computer with you. The site documents how I built a working system with it, and shares everything so you can do the same. No coding required.
