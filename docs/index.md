<div class="credibility-strip" markdown>
By [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com), professor at UChicago Harris. I manage more than a dozen research projects across multiple countries. A year ago I started building AI workflows with Claude Code. What seemed impossible then — inbox triage, meeting capture, proposal drafting, project dashboards — is running today. Claude Blattman isn't real, but the tools are.

## What You Can Do Right Away

<div class="bento-grid" markdown>
<div class="bento-cell bento-cell--featured" markdown>
:material-head-lightbulb-outline:{ .bento-icon } **[Master the chatbots](essentials/prompting.md)** — Which model, when. Thinking mode. Project folders with custom instructions. Prompt engineering that works. <span class="bento-tag bento-tag--nocode">No code needed</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-microphone-outline:{ .bento-icon } **[Speak, don't type](essentials/wispr-flow.md)** — Dictate into any app. 10 minutes of typing in 90 seconds. <span class="bento-tag bento-tag--nocode">No code needed</span>

    <span class="badge-start">No Claude Code required</span>

    Get more from the AI tools you already have. Prompt engineering that actually works — not generic tips, but tested frameworks for research, writing, and admin. Side-by-side comparisons of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Hands-free dictation with Wispr Flow. Meeting transcripts that write themselves with Granola. Plus an honest cost breakdown.

    **What you get:** Better results from chatbots today, and a clear picture of what's possible before you go deeper.

    <span class="badge-start">Start here for basics</span>

    *From zero to a working system*

    Install Claude Code, configure your first CLAUDE.md, connect your email and calendar through MCP, and run your first skill — all in an afternoon. Step-by-step guides for Mac and Windows. You'll learn the basics of prompting an agentic tool, planning multi-step tasks, and understanding what makes Claude Code different from a chatbot.

    **What you get:** A working Claude Code setup with real integrations, and the foundations for everything that follows.

    <span class="badge-start">Project management, research workflows, and the skills I actually use</span>

    The original stuff. 30+ downloadable skills built by a professor managing 15 active research projects: email triage that learns your priorities, meeting-to-action-item pipelines, project dashboards, proposal drafting, and literature workflows. This is also where you learn the intermediate arts — recursive self-improvement, teaching Claude your preferences, and building workflows that get better as you correct them.

    **What you get:** A skill library you can install and use immediately, plus the thinking behind how they work.

    <span class="badge-start">Build your own skills, agents, and systems</span>

    How to write skills from scratch, when to use agents vs. skills, and patterns for self-improving systems. This is the advanced path — you'll learn to design agentic workflows, build custom tools for your research or institution, and create systems that compound over time. Everything here builds on the prompting and planning foundations from the earlier paths.

    **What you get:** A patterns library, an agent architecture guide, and templates you can fork.
