<div class="credibility-strip" markdown>
By [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com), political economist at UChicago Harris. In January 2026 I started building AI workflows with Claude Code. What seemed impossible then — inbox triage, meeting capture, proposal drafting, project dashboards, trip planning — is running today. Claude Blattman isn't real, but the tools are. I've never coded in my life, so if I can do this you can.

## What Is This?

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is a terminal-based AI tool that can read your files, search your email, manage your calendar, and run custom workflows — like having a smart assistant sitting at your computer with you. This site documents how I built a working system with it, and shares everything so you can do the same. No coding required.

## Where to Start

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **:material-lightbulb-outline: New to AI Tools?** <span class="badge-teal">No Claude Code required</span>

    ---

    Start with the essentials: which chatbot to use, prompt engineering that works, hands-free dictation, and meeting transcription. No coding or terminal needed.

-   **:material-rocket-launch-outline: Claude Code for Newbies**

    ---

    Set up Claude Code, configure your CLAUDE.md, connect your email and calendar, and install your first skills. Step-by-step for Mac and Windows.

-   **:material-format-text: Better Prompts & Claude Code Management**

    ---

    Three skills that require nothing but Claude Code. No integrations needed. Format rough dictation into structured prompts. Stress-test any plan with expert critique. Capture session decisions automatically.

-   **:material-view-dashboard-outline: Project Management with Claude Code**

    ---

    I had emails, docs, meetings, and WhatsApp scattered across 5 platforms with no project memory. Now every project has a living dashboard that writes itself. Proposals draft themselves from the project record.

-   **:material-email-check-outline: Inbox Zero + Daily Briefings**

    ---

    I went from 5,000 unread emails to six. Morning briefings, smart triage, and calendar awareness — built one skill at a time over three weeks. The real payoff isn't time saved. It's the stress that disappears.
