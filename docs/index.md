# Claude Blattman

<p class="hero-pitch">This is what I actually use to manage 15 research projects across several countries — and my life, so I can do more research. Not a course. Not a pitch. Just the system, documented.</p>

<div class="credibility-strip" markdown>
By [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com), professor at UChicago Harris. I manage more than a dozen research projects across multiple countries. A year ago I started building AI workflows with Claude Code. What seemed impossible then — inbox triage, meeting capture, proposal drafting, project dashboards — is running today. Claude Blattman isn't real, but the tools are.

## What You Can Do Right Away

<div class="bento-grid" markdown>
<div class="bento-cell bento-cell--featured" markdown>
:material-microphone-outline:{ .bento-icon } **Speak, don't type** — Dictate into any app at full speaking speed. Wispr Flow transcribes with context-awareness; what takes 10 minutes to type takes 90 seconds to say. <span class="bento-tag bento-tag--nocode">No code needed</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-head-lightbulb-outline:{ .bento-icon } **Use AI without guessing** — Know which tool to use for which task, how to write prompts that get useful answers, and when not to bother. <span class="bento-tag bento-tag--nocode">No code needed</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-email-check-outline:{ .bento-icon } **Inbox zero, in seconds** — AI triage that learns your priorities and sorts hundreds of emails. The cleanup took me from 5,000 unread to six. <span class="bento-tag">Claude Code</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-clipboard-text-clock-outline:{ .bento-icon } **Meetings that remember themselves** — Transcripts become decisions, action items, and project log entries — without you touching a keyboard. <span class="bento-tag">Claude Code</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-view-dashboard-outline:{ .bento-icon } **Run 10 projects at once** — Status dashboards, session capture, and weekly reviews that write themselves. <span class="bento-tag">Claude Code</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-account-supervisor-outline:{ .bento-icon } **A chief of staff, always on** — Morning briefings, calendar queries, email drafts, and project check-ins. <span class="bento-tag">Claude Code</span>
</div>
<div class="bento-cell" markdown>
:material-draw-pen:{ .bento-icon } **Proposals in your voice** — AI writing and methodology agents review drafts and flag weaknesses. Not encouragement — critique. <span class="bento-tag">Claude Code</span>
</div>

    *No terminal required*

    Get more from the AI tools you already have. Prompt engineering that actually works — not generic tips, but tested frameworks for research, writing, and admin. Side-by-side comparisons of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Hands-free dictation with Wispr Flow. Meeting transcripts that write themselves with Granola. Plus an honest cost breakdown.

    **What you get:** Better results from chatbots today, and a clear picture of what's possible before you go deeper.

    <span class="badge-preview" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Start here</span>

    *From zero to a working system*

    Install Claude Code, configure your first CLAUDE.md, connect your email and calendar through MCP, and run your first skill — all in an afternoon. Step-by-step guides for Mac and Windows. You'll learn the basics of prompting an agentic tool, planning multi-step tasks, and understanding what makes Claude Code different from a chatbot.

    **What you get:** A working Claude Code setup with real integrations, and the foundations for everything that follows.

    *Project management, research workflows, and the skills I actually use*

    The original stuff. 30+ downloadable skills built by a professor managing 15 active research projects: email triage that learns your priorities, meeting-to-action-item pipelines, project dashboards, proposal drafting, and literature workflows. This is also where you learn the intermediate arts — recursive self-improvement, teaching Claude your preferences, and building workflows that get better as you correct them.

    **What you get:** A skill library you can install and use immediately, plus the thinking behind how they work.

    *Build your own skills, agents, and systems*

    How to write skills from scratch, when to use agents vs. skills, and patterns for self-improving systems. This is the advanced path — you'll learn to design agentic workflows, build custom tools for your research or institution, and create systems that compound over time. Everything here builds on the prompting and planning foundations from the earlier paths.

    **What you get:** A patterns library, an agent architecture guide, and templates you can fork.
