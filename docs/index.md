<div class="credibility-strip" markdown>
By [Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com), political economist at UChicago Harris. In January 2026 I started building AI workflows with Claude Code. What seemed impossible then — inbox triage, meeting capture, proposal drafting, project dashboards, trip planning — is running today. Claude Blattman isn't real, but the tools are. I've never coded in my life, so if I can do this you can.

## What This System Does

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **:material-view-dashboard-outline: Run 10 Research Projects**{ .lg }

    ---

    I had emails, docs, meetings, and WhatsApp scattered across 5 platforms with no project memory. Now every project has a living dashboard that writes itself.

    Weekly reviews pull from every source — transcripts, email, chat — and generate project overviews with strategic priorities. Proposals draft themselves from the project record.

-   **:material-email-check-outline: Inbox Zero + Daily Briefings**{ .lg }

    ---

    I went from 5,000 unread emails to six. Morning briefings, smart triage, and calendar awareness — built one skill at a time over three weeks.

    The real payoff isn't time saved. It's the psychological weight that disappears when you know nothing will get lost.

-   **:material-format-text: Better Prompts on Day One**{ .lg }

    ---

    Three skills that require nothing but Claude Code. No setup, no integrations — install and immediately get better results from every interaction.

    Format rough dictation into structured prompts. Stress-test any plan with expert critique. Capture session decisions automatically.
