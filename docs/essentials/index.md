# The Essentials

**Tools and foundations everyone can use today. No coding, no command line, no setup beyond creating an account.**

This path covers the AI tools and techniques that give the biggest return for the least effort. Everything here works with a web browser and (in some cases) a phone app.

## Where to Start

**If you're new to AI tools:** Start with [Chatbots Done Right](chatbots.md). It covers the fundamentals that make everything else work better.

**If you already use ChatGPT or Claude:** Skip to [Prompt Engineering](prompting.md) or browse [Wispr Flow](wispr-flow.md) / [Granola](granola.md) for tools you might not know about.

**If you want to go deeper:** Once you're comfortable here, the [Toolkit](../toolkit/index.md) path shows how to turn these foundations into automated workflows using Claude Code.

## The Stack

My current daily toolkit, for reference:

| Tool | What It Does | Cost | Essential? |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Claude** (Pro or Max) | Primary chatbot + Claude Code | $20-100/mo | Yes |
| **ChatGPT** (Plus or Pro) | Deep research, web search, image generation | $20-200/mo | Recommended |
| **Wispr Flow** | Dictation everywhere | $10/mo | Highly recommended |
| **Granola** | Meeting transcription | $10/mo | Recommended if you have meetings |

You don't need all of these. Start with one chatbot subscription and add tools as you see the value. The [Cost Reality](cost.md) page breaks this down in detail.
