# Chatbot Essentials

**I don't know if I have the best habits in the world, but these ones really changed my research and my life.**

??? tip "Some very basic advice before you dive in"

    Get a paid subscription to Claude or ChatGPT (or both). Always use the strongest model available — the quality gap is large. Give the AI context about who you are and what you need before diving into a request. The [Chatbots Done Right](chatbots.md) page covers the fundamentals; the [Prompt Engineering](prompting.md) page formalizes the full framework.

## The Stack

My current daily toolkit, for reference:

| Tool | What It Does | Cost | Essential? |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Claude** (Pro or Max) | Primary chatbot + Claude Code | $20-100/mo | Yes |
| **ChatGPT** (Plus or Pro) | Deep research, web search, image generation | $20-200/mo | Recommended |
| **Wispr Flow** | Dictation everywhere | $10/mo | Highly recommended |
| **Granola** | Meeting transcription | $10/mo | Recommended if you have meetings |
| **NotebookLM** | Document-corpus AI research | Free-$20/mo | Recommended for researchers |

You don't need all of these. Start with one chatbot subscription and add tools as you see the value. The [Cost Reality](cost.md) page breaks this down in detail.

!!! tip "Different platform or tools? Ask AI to help you adapt"
    This site documents a Mac + Zoom + WhatsApp + Gmail workflow — that's what I use.
    If you're on Windows, or your team uses Slack or Teams instead of WhatsApp, the
    concepts and skills still transfer but some setup steps will differ. Try asking
    Claude or ChatGPT: *"I use [your platform and tools]. How would I adapt this
    system for my setup?"* That's more useful than reading around steps that don't
    apply. And for any tool recommendation on this site, AI chatbots can help you
    find the right alternative for your workflow — just verify pricing and availability
    on the tool's own website.
