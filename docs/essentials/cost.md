# The Cost Reality

*Reading time: 3 minutes*

Let's be honest about what building an AI workflow costs, who it makes sense for, and who should start smaller.

## The Full Stack

Here's what my current setup costs per month:

| Tool | What It Does | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Claude Max** | Primary AI tool + Claude Code | ~$100 |
| **ChatGPT Plus** | Deep Research, web search, images | ~$20 |
| **Wispr Flow** | Dictation (Mac + iPhone) | ~$10 |
| **Granola** | Meeting transcription | ~$10 |
| **Total** | | **~$140/month** |

That's **~$1,700/year**. It's real money.

## Who Should Pay This

### Professors and Senior Researchers

If you have a research budget, this is an easy justify. At a $20/hour RA rate, this costs the equivalent of about 7 RA hours per month. If it saves you more than 7 hours — and it will, once configured — the math works.

Many universities allow software subscriptions on research accounts. Check with your grants manager.

### Organizations and NGOs

For professionals managing projects, teams, and communications, the productivity gains from email triage, meeting management, and document drafting justify the cost quickly. Especially for people whose time is expensive relative to the subscription.

### Who Should Start Smaller

**Graduate students and early-career researchers** without institutional support face a real trade-off. $1,700/year is not trivial on a graduate stipend.

**The minimum viable setup:**

| Tool | Cost | What You Get |
|------|------|-------------|
| Claude Pro | ~$20/mo | Full chatbot + basic Claude Code access |
| Apple/Google Dictation | Free | Built-in dictation (less polished than Wispr) |
| Zoom transcription | Free with Zoom | Basic meeting transcripts |
| **Total** | **~$20/month** | |

You lose the power tools, but you still get the core: a strong AI chatbot with structured prompting, basic dictation, and basic transcription. You can always upgrade as your budget and needs grow.

## ROI Framework

The question isn't "is $140/month a lot?" It's "does this save me more time than it costs?"

**Conservative estimate:** If this system saves you 5 hours per month of administrative work, and your time is worth $40/hour (a modest estimate for a professional), that's $200/month in recovered time. Net gain: $60/month.

**Realistic estimate with a configured system:** Once you have skills running for email triage, meeting processing, and project management, 10-15 hours/month of savings is achievable. At $40/hour, that's $400-600/month in recovered time.

**The honest caveat:** There's an upfront time investment to learn the tools and build the system. I spent many hours over several weeks getting my setup where it is now. The ROI is real but not instant.

## What to Try First

If you're not sure whether this is worth it, here's a low-risk sequence:

1. **Week 1:** Sign up for Claude Pro ($20/mo). Work through [Chatbots Done Right](chatbots.md) and [Prompt Engineering](prompting.md). Use Claude for one real work task daily.
2. **Week 2:** Try Wispr Flow (free trial available). See if dictation changes how you interact with AI.
3. **Week 3:** If you're getting value, try Granola for your next few meetings.
4. **Week 4:** If you want to go deeper, install Claude Code ([Install Guide](../toolkit/install-mac.md)) and try the Toolkit path.

At each step, you can stop. You don't need the full stack to get value. The chatbot alone, used well, is worth the subscription for most knowledge workers.
