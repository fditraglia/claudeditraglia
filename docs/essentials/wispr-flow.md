# Wispr Flow

Wispr Flow is a dictation tool that works everywhere — any text box on your Mac, any app on your iPhone, any field in a web browser. You talk, it types. It learns your vocabulary over time.

I basically never type anymore.

!!! note "Why this tool"
    I haven't tested every dictation app. I tried Apple's built-in dictation first and found it unreliable — too many errors, no vocabulary learning, and it only works in certain contexts. The dictation inside Claude and ChatGPT's own interfaces is surprisingly good, but it only works *inside those apps*. I wanted system-wide dictation: emails, VS Code, Claude Code, web forms, everything. Wispr Flow does that seamlessly. The alternatives below may work equally well — check them against your workflow.

## Why Dictation Changes Everything

Dictation isn't new. But previous tools (Apple's built-in, Google's, Dragon) were unreliable enough that most people gave up. Wispr Flow is the first one I've used that works well enough to replace typing for most tasks.

**The math:** I type at maybe 60 words per minute on a good day. I speak at 150+ words per minute. That's a 2-3x speed increase on any text-heavy task — and it eliminates the friction of starting. It's much easier to *talk through* an idea than to *write* it from scratch.

**The real payoff isn't speed — it's starting.** The hardest part of writing an email, a proposal section, or a meeting summary is getting the first words down. Dictation makes that effortless. You talk your way through it, then edit.

## What Wispr Flow Does

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Mac hotkey** | Hold a key → dictate → release to transcribe. Works in any text field. |
| **iPhone keyboard** | Replaces the default keyboard's dictation. Works in any app. |
| **Vocabulary learning** | Learns names, jargon, and unusual words over time. |
| **Language switching** | Handles multilingual input (e.g., English/Spanish mixed). |
| **Formatting awareness** | Recognizes context (email vs. code vs. notes) and adjusts punctuation. |

**Cost:** ~$10/month.

**Platforms:** Mac and iOS. No Windows or Android version (as of February 2026).

## How I Use It

### Email

I dictate almost every email. For quick replies, I dictate directly into Gmail. For longer messages, I dictate into Claude (or Claude Code) and let it format the response.

### AI Prompts

This is where dictation + AI becomes a pipeline:

1. **Dictate** a rough, conversational request into Claude Code
2. **Use the `/prompt` skill** to reformat it into a structured prompt
3. **Get polished output** from the formatted prompt

The whole sequence takes 30 seconds for a task that would take 5 minutes typing and formatting manually.

### Meeting Notes

During or right after meetings, I dictate quick summaries and next steps. Faster and more natural than typing notes.

### Writing First Drafts

For any first draft — proposal sections, paper introductions, blog posts — I dictate a rough version and then edit. The draft is rarely good as-is, but it's dramatically faster than staring at a blank page.

## Alternatives

If Wispr Flow doesn't work for your platform or budget:

| Tool | Platform | Price | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Apple Dictation** | Mac/iOS | Free | Built-in. Decent for short bursts. Doesn't learn vocabulary. |
| [**Superwhisper**](https://superwhisper.com/) | Mac/iOS | $10/mo | Local AI processing (privacy-focused). Very accurate. Supports offline use. |
| [**Aqua Voice**](https://www.aquavoice.com/) | Mac/Windows | $8/mo | Extremely fast (sub-50ms). System-wide, like Wispr Flow. |
| [**Voibe**](https://www.getvoibe.com/) | Mac | Free-$10/mo | 100% offline, on-device processing. Good for privacy-sensitive work. |
| **Google Voice Typing** | Any (via Google Docs) | Free | Works well. Requires Google Docs — not system-wide. |
| [**Whisper**](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (OpenAI) | Any (via apps) | Free/varies | Open-source speech-to-text. Requires technical setup or a third-party app. |

Wispr Flow's advantage is that it works everywhere on your Mac/iPhone without switching apps. But any dictation tool is better than no dictation tool.

**Availability:** Wispr Flow works on Mac, Windows, and iOS. It's available globally and supports 100+ languages with automatic detection. There are no geographic restrictions as of early 2026.

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** at [wispr.flow](https://www.wispr.flow/) (Mac app + iOS keyboard)
2. **Set your hotkey** — I use a dedicated key, but any modifier combo works
3. **Train it** — The first few days it'll get some words wrong. Correct them and it learns.
4. **Use it for everything** — The more you use it, the better it gets at your vocabulary

The learning curve is about a week. After that, typing feels painfully slow.
