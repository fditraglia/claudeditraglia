# ChatGPT vs Claude: Chatbot Comparison

<span class="badge-teal">No Claude Code required</span>

I pay for and use both ChatGPT and Claude every day. Here's an honest comparison from someone with no loyalty to either company.

## When I Use ChatGPT

### Deep Research

ChatGPT's Deep Research feature is the single best reason to have a ChatGPT subscription. Give it a question, and it spends 5-30 minutes searching the web, synthesizing multiple sources, and producing a structured report with citations.

**Example uses:**
- "Survey the literature on cash transfer programs and crime reduction"
- "What are the current best practices for pre-analysis plans in RCTs?"
- "Compare the costs and features of all major meeting transcription tools"

Claude can do web searches, but they're shallow — a few queries, surface-level results. ChatGPT Deep Research goes meaningfully deeper.

### Image Generation

When I need visuals — diagrams, presentation images, conceptual illustrations — ChatGPT handles this natively. Claude doesn't generate images.

### Quick Web Lookups

For "what's the current status of X" questions where I need live information, ChatGPT's web access is more reliable.

## When I Use Claude

### Everything in Claude Code

This is the big one. Claude Code — the terminal-based tool that reads your files, manages your email, and runs custom skills — has no real ChatGPT equivalent. If you use Claude Code, Claude is your primary AI tool by default.

### Long-Form Writing and Editing

For drafting and editing prose — proposals, papers, reports — Claude consistently produces better output. It's better at maintaining a consistent voice, following structural instructions, and providing substantive (not just surface) feedback.

### Complex Reasoning

For tasks that require careful, multi-step reasoning — research design, methodology review, strategic planning — Claude Opus 4.6 tends to produce more thoughtful, nuanced output than GPT-4o. (ChatGPT's o1 and o3 models are competitive for pure reasoning puzzles, but less practical for open-ended analysis.)

### Projects and Persistent Context

Claude.ai's Projects feature lets you create a workspace with instructions and files that persist across conversations. This is better than ChatGPT's memory system for structured, project-based work.

## Cost Comparison

*Prices as of February 2026 — verify at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and [chatgpt.com/pricing](https://chatgpt.com/pricing) for current rates.*

| Tier | ChatGPT | Claude |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Free** | GPT-4o (limited) | Sonnet 4.6 (limited) |
| **Basic paid** | Plus: $20/mo | Pro: $20/mo |
| **Power user** | Pro: $200/mo | Max: $100-200/mo |
| **API/developer** | Pay per token | Pay per token |

The $200/mo ChatGPT Pro tier gets you unlimited access to all models including o1-pro. Claude's Max tiers ($100 or $200/mo) get you higher usage limits for Opus 4.6 and Claude Code.

**My setup:** Claude Max ($100/mo) + ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo). I use Claude for 80% of my work and ChatGPT for research and web tasks. Total: $120/mo.

## The Bottom Line

**If you can only pick one:** Claude, especially if you plan to use Claude Code. The developer tools and code capabilities make it the better foundation for building a workflow system.

**If you can afford both:** Use Claude as your primary tool and ChatGPT for Deep Research and web-heavy tasks. They're genuinely complementary.

**If you're just starting:** Start with whichever one you already have. The techniques in [Chatbots Done Right](chatbots.md) and [Prompt Engineering](prompting.md) work with both.
