# Project Folders for Work

*Part of [AI Project Folders](../project-folders.md)*

---

I now manage almost all of my research projects through Claude Code, and I think it deserves a thorough treatment. I've been focusing on building out that part of the site first. In the meantime, three substantive points.

## 1. The Same Principles Apply

Everything from the life folders — instructions files, uploaded sources, the narrate-interview-synthesize process — works for professional tasks. Writing, proposals, reports, literature reviews, course prep. The AI is a genuinely good writing tool when it knows your voice, your standards, and your constraints. Start with the life examples to learn the pattern:

- [Vacation Planning](vacation.md) — the full walkthrough
- [Shopping Decisions](shopping.md) — a simpler, instructions-only example
- [Health & Fitness](health.md) — research and consultation mode

## 2. ChatGPT Deep Research Is Worth the Subscription

**ChatGPT's Deep Research reports may be the single most valuable AI tool for faculty right now.**

You get a limited number per month with a Plus subscription and seemingly unlimited with Pro. For a faculty member, this alone can justify the cost of a Pro subscription.

I work on organized crime, gangs, and drug markets. I have a project folder where I collect Deep Research reports — I run one every day or two on core questions. How is the drug trade organized in a particular region? What's the background on a specific city's security situation? What does the evidence say about a particular intervention?

These reports surface useful, detailed information that would take hours of manual searching. The key is **prompt engineering** — give the model a clear pathway for what you want, structure the output format, and include explicit instructions to minimize hallucinations and cite sources. A well-engineered prompt is the difference between a generic summary and a genuinely useful research briefing.

## 3. Claude Code for Project Management

Where project folders give you better *conversations*, Claude Code gives you better *systems*. The [Get Started](../../setup/index.md) section covers this in depth, but the short version: skills build on each other.

I started with a [weekly review](../../setup/skill-reference.md) skill that summarized what happened across my projects each week. That led to project management skills that tracked status, decisions, and next steps across 15+ simultaneous research projects. Those in turn made it possible to build proposal drafting skills — because the AI already knew the project context, the team, and the timeline.

Each layer made the next one possible. That compounding is the real payoff of Claude Code, and it's what I'll document here when this page expands.
