# Claude Code for Newbies

**The terminal is the biggest hurdle.** Once you get past it, everything else is learnable. You don't need to be a coder — I've never written a line of code in my life, and I built everything on this site with Claude Code.

This section takes you from zero to a working system. If you want to see what the system *does* before setting it up, start with [Skills in Action](../workflows/index.md).

## Two Ways to Run Claude Code

Claude Code works the same way regardless of how you run it. But the *container* you run it in makes a real difference in how comfortable the experience feels.

| | **Terminal** | **VS Code + Claude Code Extension** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | The text-only command line that comes with your Mac or PC | A free code editor by Microsoft with a Claude Code sidebar |
| **What it looks like** | Black screen, blinking cursor, text only | Visual file explorer on the left, editor in the center, Claude panel on the side |
| **Learning curve** | Steeper — no visual cues, easy to feel lost | Gentler — you can see your files, click to open them, and watch Claude's changes appear as highlighted diffs |
| **Best for** | Quick one-off tasks, experienced terminal users | Longer work sessions, people who want to see what's happening, anyone who finds a blank terminal intimidating |

**My recommendation:** I use VS Code. The visual layout makes it less intimidating, and you can see your files and Claude's changes side by side. Either way works — the install guides below use Terminal (you need it for the initial install regardless), and you can switch to VS Code right after.

## Prerequisites

Before starting:

1. **Have used a chatbot** (Claude.ai or ChatGPT) at least a few times
2. **Have a paid Anthropic account** (Claude Pro at minimum; Claude Max recommended for heavy use)
3. **Be comfortable with the idea of using a terminal** — you don't need experience, but you do need willingness

If you haven't used chatbots much yet, start with [The Essentials](../essentials/index.md) first.

## What You'll End Up With

After working through this section:

- **Claude Code installed and authenticated** on your computer
- **VS Code configured** with the Claude Code extension (optional but recommended)
- **A CLAUDE.md file** that tells Claude about your role, projects, and preferences
- **MCP integrations** connecting Claude to your email, calendar, and documents
- **A library of skills** (slash commands) that automate recurring tasks
- **A system that improves over time** as you add skills and refine your configuration

The whole setup takes a few hours spread over a couple of sessions. The time investment pays for itself within the first week of regular use.
