# About

## About This Project

Claude Blattman is a free, open-source resource for building AI workflows. It documents the system I've built for managing research projects, shared so others can use it.

The name is a joke. The tools are real.

## About Chris Blattman

I'm a political economist at the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on violence, crime, and poverty — I design and test interventions in cities across Latin America and Africa. You can read more about my research and writing at [chrisblattman.com](https://chrisblattman.com).

I'm not a coder — I've never written a line of code in my life. Everything on this site was built with AI tools.

## How I Got Here {: .section-hero }

Like most academics, the work that matters — [the research](https://chrisblattman.com/research/), the writing, the thinking — gets buried under an avalanche of email, coordination, proposals, and administrative overhead. I manage a large portfolio of research projects simultaneously, each with distributed teams across multiple countries. I spend more time answering emails and writing grant reports than doing the science I was trained for.

For the past year I intensively used [AI chatbots](essentials/index.md). They were invaluable — deep research, better drafts, faster brainstorming, decent writing feedback. But they were limited. The time savings were real but modest.

Then in January 2026 I discovered [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), and the center of gravity shifted from chatbots to agentic tools — AI that can read your files, search your email, manage your calendar, and build workflows that improve themselves over time.

I spent hours daily for a month building skills and processes. The time investment hasn't paid off yet in pure hours saved, but I can see where this is going — and things that seemed impossible are working today.

### The One-Time Cleanup

After 20 years of digital life, I had thousands of unread emails, fragmented calendars, and files scattered across multiple cloud services. A day and a half with Claude Code and it was under control — 5,000 unread emails down to 6. That sold me. ([Full process](toolkit/executive-assistant.md#the-one-time-cleanup) · [Cloud storage guide](downloads/cloud-storage-guide.md))

### Why I'm Sharing This

I built this site because I'm in the same position as most of my readers: buried in admin, not a developer, trying to claw back time for work that actually matters.

If a non-technical professor can build a working AI workflow system, you can too.

This site is the whole thing — tutorials, downloadable tools, honest assessments of what works and what doesn't — shared freely as a public good. It's not a product. It's not a course. It's one person's system, documented so you can learn from it and build your own.

I write about research, conflict, policy, and increasingly about AI tools on [X/Twitter (@cblatts)](https://twitter.com/cblatts) and at [chrisblattman.com](https://chrisblattman.com).

## How This Site Was Built

This site is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and auto-deploys on every push via GitHub Actions.

The content was written with help from Claude. The skills and workflows documented here are the same ones I use daily.

## Acknowledgments

This project builds on the work of many people sharing their AI workflows publicly. Special thanks to the reference implementations that influenced this system — credited on the [Resources](resources.md) page.

Thanks also to my research assistants who help maintain and improve these tools, and to the Claude Code team at Anthropic for building something genuinely useful.
