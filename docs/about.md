## About This Project

Claude Blattman is a free, open-source resource for building AI workflows. It documents the system I've built for managing research projects, and shares it so others can learn from it or steal the useful parts.

The name is a joke. The tools are real.

## About Chris Blattman

I'm a professor at the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on violence, crime, and poverty — I design and test interventions in cities across Latin America and Africa. You can read more about my research and writing at [chrisblattman.com](https://chrisblattman.com).

I'm not a coder. The closest I come to programming is writing statistical analysis files in Stata and R. Everything on this site was built using AI tools by someone with no software engineering background.

## How I Got Here

Like most academics, the work that matters — [the research](https://chrisblattman.com/research/), the writing, the thinking — gets buried under an avalanche of email, coordination, proposals, and administrative overhead. I manage more than a dozen research projects simultaneously, each with distributed teams across multiple countries. I spend more time answering emails and writing grant reports than doing the science I was trained for.

About a year ago, I started using AI chatbots. They were useful — better drafts, faster brainstorming, decent writing feedback. But they were essentially fancy text boxes. Copy in, copy out. The time savings were real but modest.

Then something changed. I discovered [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), and the center of gravity shifted from chatbots to *agentic tools* — AI that can read your files, search your email, manage your calendar, and build workflows that improve themselves over time.

I went down a rabbit hole. I spent hours daily for a month building skills and processes. I won't pretend the time investment has paid off yet in pure hours saved. But I can already see where this is going. And the things that seemed impossible six months ago — a system that triages my inbox, summarizes my meetings, tracks my projects, and drafts my proposals — are working today.

### The One-Time Cleanup

Here's what convinced me this was real: After 20 years of digital life, I had 5,000 unread emails, calendars scattered across iCalendar and Google, files across Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and iCloud, and an overflowing hard drive. A day and a half with Claude Code and my inbox was down to six emails, my calendars were consolidated, obsolete cloud folders were shut down, and everything was cataloged.

It was like having a magic cleanup team come into a hoarder's basement.

That one-time cleanup sold me. Not because AI did it perfectly — it didn't — but because it did in 36 hours what I'd been failing to do for a decade.

### Why I'm Sharing This

I built this site because I'm in the same position as most of my readers: buried in admin, not a developer, trying to claw back time for [work that actually matters](https://chrisblattman.com/research/).

If a non-technical professor can build a working AI workflow system, you can too.

This site is the whole thing — tutorials, downloadable tools, honest assessments of what works and what doesn't — shared freely as a public good. It's not a product. It's not a course. It's one person's system, documented so you can learn from it and build your own.

I write about research, conflict, policy, and increasingly about AI tools on [X/Twitter (@cblatts)](https://twitter.com/cblatts) and at [chrisblattman.com](https://chrisblattman.com).

## How This Site Was Built

This site is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfork.github.io/mkdocs-material/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and auto-deploys on every push via GitHub Actions.

The content was written with help from Claude (naturally). The skills and workflows documented here are the same ones I use daily.

## Acknowledgments

This project builds on the work of many people sharing their AI workflows publicly. Special thanks to the reference implementations that influenced this system — credited on the [Resources](resources.md) page.

Thanks also to my research assistants who help maintain and improve these tools, and to the Claude Code team at Anthropic for building something genuinely useful.
