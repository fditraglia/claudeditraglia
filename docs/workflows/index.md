# Skills in Action

These aren't individual tools — they're **systems** built from skills, integrations, and habits that compound over time. Each page tells the story of how the workflow developed, what it actually does, and how to build it yourself.

    ---

    From scattered emails, docs, and meetings across 5 platforms to living project dashboards with weekly reviews and on-demand proposals. Built in four layers, each one building on the last.

    ---

    From 5,000 unread emails to inbox zero. Morning briefings, smart triage, calendar queries, and communication drafting — assembled from components over three weeks.

-   **:material-format-text: First Session Skills**

    ---

    Three skills that work on day one. No MCP setup, no configuration files, no integrations. Install Claude Code, install these, and get better results immediately.

## How These Connect

The three workflows serve different needs and timelines:

| Workflow | What it solves | Setup time | When to start |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **First Session Skills** | Better prompts and session capture | 5 minutes | Day 1 |
| **Executive Assistant** | Email, calendar, daily workflow | 1-3 weeks of iteration | After MCP is configured |
| **Project Management** | Multi-project oversight and reporting | 3+ weeks of iteration | After EA basics are working |

You don't need all three. Start wherever your biggest pain point is. But they're designed to layer — the project management workflow works best when you already have inbox triage and meeting capture running.
