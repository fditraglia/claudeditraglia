STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE (NORTH STAR)
Estimate the causal impact of an adapted CBT + life skills + mentorship intervention ("Pathways") on youth violence, criminal involvement, and economic outcomes among high-risk adolescents in Kingston, Jamaica — and identify which components drive the effects.

---

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
1. Complete Cohort 2 screening and randomization by March 15
2. Maintain Cohort 1 treatment fidelity above 80% session attendance
3. Finalize midline survey instrument and pilot by end of February

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

- Community liaison trust and cooperation in all three neighborhoods
  Status: GREEN
  Owner: Andre Campbell
  Note: Tivoli Gardens liaison confirmed continued cooperation after Jan community meeting. August Town relationship solid. Trench Town requires ongoing engagement — new community leader elected in January.

- Screening tool validity and completion rate
  Status: GREEN
  Owner: Marcus Chen
  Note: Cohort 1 screening completion rate 94%. Adapted SAVRY/YLS-CMI performing well. Two items flagged for cultural adaptation review (see Research Design doc).

- Treatment fidelity and facilitator quality
  Status: YELLOW
  Owner: Karen Thompson
  Note: Average session attendance 76% (target 80%). Two of six facilitators below threshold. Remediation plan in place — additional training session scheduled Feb 20. One facilitator (Trench Town site B) may need replacement.

- IRB and ethics compliance across institutions
  Status: GREEN
  Owner: Chris Blattman
  Note: UChicago IRB renewal approved through Dec 2026. UWI Mona ethics committee renewal submitted Jan 30, expected approval by Feb 28. No adverse events reported.

- Cohort enrollment targets
  Status: GREEN
  Owner: Marcus Chen
  Note: Cohort 1 enrolled 380/400 target (95%). Cohort 2 screening underway with 290 of ~400 screened. On track.

- USAID reporting and relationship
  Status: GREEN
  Owner: Chris Blattman
  Note: Q1 progress report submitted Feb 1. Program officer (David Reyes) positive on enrollment numbers. Site visit tentatively scheduled for April.

WHERE WE ARE

Cohort 1 (n=380) is nine weeks into the 16-week Pathways intervention. Treatment group attendance averaging 76%, slightly below our 80% target, concentrated in two facilitator groups. We have a remediation plan. Control group contamination checks show no evidence of spillover — the community-level randomization is holding.

Cohort 2 screening is 73% complete (290/~400). We're running two screening teams across Trench Town and August Town simultaneously. Tivoli Gardens screening starts next week. Randomization planned for March 15 pending screening completion.

The midline survey instrument is in second-round revision. Karen flagged concerns about the self-reported violence module — response rates on sensitive items were low in the Cohort 1 baseline. We're testing list experiment and endorsement experiment alternatives for the midline.

Budget is on track. USAID Q1 disbursement received. J-PAL supplemental ($150K) confirmed but not yet disbursed — expected March.

KEY CHALLENGES

1. Treatment fidelity below target. Two facilitators below 80% attendance threshold. If remediation doesn't work, we need replacement facilitators — which means retraining and potentially losing 2-3 weeks of Cohort 1 treatment time. Karen leading this.

2. Sensitive survey items. Self-reported violence measures had low response rates at baseline (68% on the most sensitive items). Need a measurement solution before midline. List experiments add survey length but may be necessary.

3. Trench Town community leadership transition. New community leader elected January — doesn't know the project. Andre is building the relationship but it's early. This affects Cohort 2 screening in Trench Town and eventually Cohort 3.

4. J-PAL disbursement timing. The $150K supplemental is confirmed but disbursement is slow. We're covering Cohort 2 screening costs from the USAID budget, but need the J-PAL funds before Cohort 3 to avoid a gap.

---

FUNDING PIPELINE

  USAID (primary): $800K over 3 years. Q1 disbursement received ($200K). On track.
  J-PAL LAC (supplemental): $150K. Approved, disbursement expected March 2026.
  Total budget: $950K. Spent to date: $218K (23%).
  No new funding applications pending.
  Potential: IDRC expression of interest for qualitative component add-on ($80K). Chris to discuss with Karen.

### Meeting: Kingston Youth Futures Weekly Check-In
Date: 2026-02-12 (Wednesday), 10:00 AM EST
Participants: Chris Blattman, Karen Thompson, Marcus Chen, Andre Campbell, Devon Brown (via Zoom)
Duration: 58 minutes
Source: Granola transcript

#### 1. Cohort 1 Treatment Fidelity Review

Devon presented the latest attendance data. Overall treatment group attendance is 76%, down slightly from 78% two weeks ago. The decline is concentrated in two facilitator groups:

- **Facilitator Group 3 (Trench Town site B):** 64% average attendance. The facilitator, Marlon, has been inconsistent with session scheduling and two participants reported feeling the sessions "weren't relevant." Karen noted this is the same facilitator flagged in the January review. She recommended we proceed with a replacement rather than another round of coaching.

- **Facilitator Group 5 (August Town site A):** 71% average attendance. This appears to be a transportation issue rather than facilitator quality — the session venue changed in January and several participants have longer travel times. Marcus is looking into a venue closer to the original location.

The other four groups are all above 82%, with Group 1 (Trench Town site A) at 89% — the highest in the study.

**Decision:** Karen will lead one more remediation training on Feb 20 that includes all facilitators (not just underperformers, to avoid stigma). If Group 3 attendance doesn't improve to 72% by Mar 1, we replace Marlon. VPA has two backup facilitators who completed training in December but weren't assigned.

Chris raised the question of whether we need to document the facilitator variation for the paper. Karen agreed it's important — differential treatment intensity by facilitator is a potential source of heterogeneity. Devon will compile a facilitator-level attendance dataset that we can use in analysis. Marcus noted we should also track session content fidelity, not just attendance — whether facilitators are covering all module components. Karen will add a fidelity checklist to the observation protocol.

#### 2. Cohort 2 Screening Progress

Marcus reported 290 screened out of a target of approximately 400. Two screening teams are running in parallel — one in Trench Town (led by Keisha) and one in August Town (led by Tamara, with Devon assisting remotely on data entry).

Trench Town screening is slightly behind schedule. Marcus attributed this to the community leadership transition — the new leader, Mr. Patterson, initially wanted to "review the project" before allowing continued access. Andre met with him twice and it's now resolved, but they lost about four days.

**Tivoli Gardens screening** starts Feb 17. Andre confirmed the community liaison (Ms. Green) is ready and has identified the screening venue — the same community center used for Cohort 1. Andre noted one concern: a recent incident of gang violence in the area (Feb 5) has increased tensions. He recommended waiting until the following week to start if tensions remain elevated. The group discussed and agreed Andre should make a game-day decision based on local conditions.

Marcus presented the screening data quality so far. The adapted SAVRY/YLS-CMI is performing well — completion rate 94%, average screening time 35 minutes. Two items flagged for review:

- **Item 14 (peer delinquency):** High refusal rate (12%). Youth seem reluctant to name or discuss friends' activities. Keisha suggested rewording to ask about "people you spend time with" rather than "friends" — less socially loaded.

- **Item 22 (substance use):** Possible social desirability bias — rates seem low compared to national survey data for this age group. Karen suggested adding a bogus pipeline technique to the midline as a validity check, but noted it adds complexity.

**Decision:** Keep current screening tool as-is for Cohort 2 (consistency with Cohort 1). Flag items 14 and 22 for revision before Cohort 3. Marcus will document the concerns in the screening protocol memo.

#### 3. Midline Survey Design

Karen presented the revised midline instrument (v2.1). The major change is the proposed switch from direct self-report to **list experiments** for the three most sensitive violence items:

1. "In the past 3 months, have you been in a physical fight?"
2. "In the past 3 months, have you carried a weapon?"
3. "In the past 3 months, have you been involved in gang-related activity?"

At baseline, these items had response rates of 78%, 65%, and 68% respectively — well below the 95%+ response rate on non-sensitive items. Karen walked through the list experiment design:

- Control list: 4 innocuous items (e.g., "visited a doctor," "attended a religious service")
- Treatment list: Same 4 items + 1 sensitive item
- Randomly assign half of respondents to each list per item
- Need ~200 per list per item for adequate power

Chris raised two concerns. First, list experiments sacrifice individual-level measurement — we get prevalence estimates but can't link responses to individual treatment effects. This limits heterogeneity analysis. Karen acknowledged this but argued that biased direct reports are worse than imprecise list experiments. She proposed a **combined design**: direct self-report first (for those willing), then list experiment for everyone. We can compare the two and use the list experiment to correct for bias.

Second concern: survey length. The current instrument is 45 minutes. Adding list experiments for three items adds approximately 8 minutes. Karen noted we could cut the time-use module (10 minutes) to compensate — it was included for the descriptive paper but isn't essential for the main experimental estimates.

**Decision:** Proceed with combined design (direct report + list experiment). Cut the detailed time-use module; keep the abbreviated version (3 items instead of 12). Keisha will program the list experiments in SurveyCTO and pilot Feb 24-28 with 30 control group participants from Cohort 1.

#### 4. Partner Coordination and Upcoming Events

Chris updated the team on the USAID Q1 report, submitted Feb 1. David Reyes (program officer) responded positively, particularly about the enrollment numbers and community engagement strategy. He mentioned a possible site visit in April — no date confirmed yet. Chris will follow up to nail down timing so we can prepare.

Karen reported that the UWI Mona ethics committee renewal is pending. She submitted Jan 30 and expects approval by end of February. No issues anticipated — this is a routine annual renewal with no protocol changes.

Andre raised the question of the Ministry of National Security quarterly update. The last briefing was Jan 15. The next one should be in April, ideally timed with the USAID visit if possible so Chris only needs to travel once. Karen offered to present the qualitative findings at the Ministry briefing to add depth beyond the quantitative enrollment numbers.

Marcus flagged that the IPA Jamaica contract renewal went through. His position is secure through Dec 2026. He also noted that IPA's regional director (Sandra Lewis) will be in Kingston in March and wants to visit the field sites. Marcus will coordinate.

**Action items from this discussion:**
- Chris to follow up with David Reyes on April site visit timing
- Karen to coordinate with Ministry of National Security for April briefing
- Marcus to schedule Sandra Lewis field visit (March)
- Andre to assess Tivoli Gardens security situation before Feb 17 screening launch

### Meeting: Kingston Youth Futures — Midline Design Working Session
Date: 2026-02-05 (Wednesday), 2:00 PM EST
Participants: Chris Blattman, Karen Thompson, Keisha Williams (via Zoom)
Duration: 42 minutes
Source: Granola transcript

*Note: This summary was generated from a meeting transcript by Claude Code. It captures key discussions and decisions but may not reflect every comment or nuance. Team members should flag any corrections.*

#### 1. Baseline Data Review for Midline Planning

Chris opened with baseline summary statistics from Cohort 1. Key findings relevant to midline design:

- **Balance check:** Treatment and control groups well-balanced on all 14 baseline covariates. Largest normalized difference is 0.08 SD (household income). No concerns.
- **Violence measures:** As noted above, direct self-report items on violence had 65-78% response rates. Non-sensitive items averaged 96%. The gap confirms measurement concerns.
- **Risk scores:** The adapted SAVRY/YLS-CMI classified 31% of the sample as high-risk, 45% as moderate, and 24% as low. This distribution is close to what we expected based on the pilot data from 2024.
- **Attrition concern:** 6 participants (1.6%) unreachable at the 4-week check-in. All in control group. Marcus is following up with community liaisons. Not yet concerning but worth monitoring.

#### 2. List Experiment Technical Design

Keisha presented three design options for the list experiments. After discussion, the group settled on the **double list** approach — each respondent sees both a short list (3 items) and a long list (4 items, one sensitive), randomly assigned to which list is short vs. long. This approach:

- Reduces floor/ceiling effects
- Allows internal consistency checks
- Adds minimal time vs. single list

Keisha estimated programming time: 2 weeks in SurveyCTO, including randomization logic and built-in quality checks. The pilot on Feb 24-28 will test comprehension, timing, and enumerator comfort.

#### 3. Endorsement Experiment Alternative

Karen raised endorsement experiments as an alternative for the gang involvement item specifically. Rather than asking about own involvement, the endorsement experiment asks about support for policies or organizations associated with gangs. The idea: treatment may shift attitudes toward gangs even if participants won't report their own behavior.

Chris liked the idea conceptually but was concerned about interpretation — endorsement experiments measure attitudes, not behavior, and our primary outcomes are behavioral. The group agreed to include one endorsement experiment item as a secondary outcome but not replace the list experiment.

**Decision:** Primary sensitive measurement via list experiments. Add one endorsement experiment item on gang-related attitudes as secondary outcome. Keisha to program both.
