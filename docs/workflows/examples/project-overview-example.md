WHERE WE ARE

Cohort 1 (n=380) is nine weeks into the 12-week Jipange program. Training group attendance averaging 76%, slightly below our 80% target, concentrated in two trainer groups. We have a remediation plan. Control group contamination checks show no evidence of spillover — the market-cluster randomization is holding.

Cohort 2 screening is 73% complete (290/~400). We're running two screening teams across Eastleigh and Kawangware simultaneously. Gikomba screening starts next week. Randomization planned for March 15 pending screening completion.

The midline survey instrument is in second-round revision. James flagged concerns about the self-reported income module — response rates on sensitive items were low in the Cohort 1 baseline. We're testing list experiment and indirect question alternatives for the midline.

Budget is on track. Gates Foundation Q1 disbursement received. IDRC supplemental ($120K) confirmed but not yet disbursed — expected March.

KEY CHALLENGES

1. Training fidelity below target. Two trainers below 80% attendance threshold. If remediation doesn't work, we need replacement trainers — which means retraining and potentially losing 2-3 weeks of Cohort 1 program time. James leading this.

2. Sensitive survey items. Self-reported income and savings measures had low response rates at baseline (68% on the most sensitive items). Need a measurement solution before midline. List experiments add survey length but may be necessary.

3. Eastleigh market leadership transition. New market chair elected January — doesn't know the project. Faith is building the relationship but it's early. This affects Cohort 2 screening in Eastleigh and eventually Cohort 3.

4. IDRC disbursement timing. The $120K supplemental is confirmed but disbursement is slow. We're covering Cohort 2 screening costs from the Gates budget, but need the IDRC funds before Cohort 3 to avoid a gap.

---

FUNDING PIPELINE

  Gates Foundation (primary): $700K over 3 years. Q1 disbursement received ($175K). On track.
  IDRC (supplemental): $120K. Approved, disbursement expected March 2026.

### Meeting: Nairobi Digital Futures Weekly Check-In
Date: 2026-02-12 (Wednesday), 10:00 AM EAT
Participants: Sarah Okonkwo, James Mwangi, Lisa Park, Faith Wambui, Daniel Ochieng (via Zoom)
Duration: 58 minutes
Source: Granola transcript

#### 1. Cohort 1 Training Fidelity Review

Daniel presented the latest attendance data. Overall training group attendance is 76%, down slightly from 78% two weeks ago. The decline is concentrated in two trainer groups:

- **Trainer Group 3 (Eastleigh site B):** 64% average attendance. The trainer, Rose, has been inconsistent with session scheduling and two participants reported feeling the sessions "weren't relevant." James noted this is the same trainer flagged in the January review. He recommended we proceed with a replacement rather than another round of coaching.

- **Trainer Group 5 (Kawangware site A):** 71% average attendance. This appears to be a transportation issue rather than trainer quality — the session venue changed in January and several participants have longer travel times. Lisa is looking into a venue closer to the original location.

The other four groups are all above 82%, with Group 1 (Eastleigh site A) at 89% — the highest in the study.

**Decision:** James will lead one more remediation training on Feb 20 that includes all trainers (not just underperformers, to avoid stigma). If Group 3 attendance doesn't improve to 72% by Mar 1, we replace Rose. The Kenya Women's Enterprise Fund has two backup trainers who completed training in December but weren't assigned.

Sarah raised the question of whether we need to document the trainer variation for the paper. James agreed it's important — differential training intensity by trainer is a potential source of heterogeneity. Daniel will compile a trainer-level attendance dataset that we can use in analysis. Lisa noted we should also track session content fidelity, not just attendance — whether trainers are covering all module components. James will add a fidelity checklist to the observation protocol.

#### 2. Cohort 2 Screening Progress

Lisa reported 290 screened out of a target of approximately 400. Two screening teams are running in parallel — one in Eastleigh (led by Priya) and one in Kawangware (led by Grace, with Daniel assisting remotely on data entry).

Eastleigh screening is slightly behind schedule. Lisa attributed this to the market leadership transition — the new chair, Mrs. Oduya, initially wanted to "review the project" before allowing continued access. Faith met with her twice and it's now resolved, but they lost about four days.

**Gikomba Market screening** starts Feb 17. Faith confirmed the market association liaison (Mrs. Kamau) is ready and has identified the screening venue — the same community hall used for Cohort 1. Faith noted one concern: a recent dispute between vendor associations in the area (Feb 5) has increased tensions. She recommended waiting until the following week to start if tensions remain elevated. The group discussed and agreed Faith should make a game-day decision based on local conditions.

Lisa presented the screening data quality so far. The adapted FINDEX-based financial capability assessment is performing well — completion rate 94%, average screening time 35 minutes. Two items flagged for review:

- **Item 14 (informal borrowing):** High refusal rate (12%). Women seem reluctant to discuss borrowing from informal lenders. Priya suggested rewording to ask about "people who help you when money is short" rather than "lenders" — less stigmatizing.

- **Item 22 (savings amounts):** Possible social desirability bias — reported savings seem high compared to national survey data for this income group. James suggested adding a validation cross-check with M-Pesa records at midline, but noted it adds complexity.

**Decision:** Keep current screening tool as-is for Cohort 2 (consistency with Cohort 1). Flag items 14 and 22 for revision before Cohort 3. Lisa will document the concerns in the screening protocol memo.

#### 3. Midline Survey Design

James presented the revised midline instrument (v2.1). The major change is the proposed switch from direct self-report to **list experiments** for the three most sensitive financial items:

1. "In the past 3 months, have you borrowed from an informal money lender?"
2. "In the past 3 months, have you missed a loan repayment?"
3. "In the past 3 months, have you hidden income or savings from your household?"

At baseline, these items had response rates of 78%, 65%, and 68% respectively — well below the 95%+ response rate on non-sensitive items. James walked through the list experiment design:

- Control list: 4 innocuous items (e.g., "visited a health clinic," "attended a market association meeting")
- Treatment list: Same 4 items + 1 sensitive item
- Randomly assign half of respondents to each list per item
- Need ~200 per list per item for adequate power

Sarah raised two concerns. First, list experiments sacrifice individual-level measurement — we get prevalence estimates but can't link responses to individual treatment effects. This limits heterogeneity analysis. James acknowledged this but argued that biased direct reports are worse than imprecise list experiments. He proposed a **combined design**: direct self-report first (for those willing), then list experiment for everyone. We can compare the two and use the list experiment to correct for bias.

Second concern: survey length. The current instrument is 45 minutes. Adding list experiments for three items adds approximately 8 minutes. James noted we could cut the time-use module (10 minutes) to compensate — it was included for the descriptive paper but isn't essential for the main experimental estimates.

**Decision:** Proceed with combined design (direct report + list experiment). Cut the detailed time-use module; keep the abbreviated version (3 items instead of 12). Priya will program the list experiments in SurveyCTO and pilot Feb 24-28 with 30 control group participants from Cohort 1.

#### 4. Partner Coordination and Upcoming Events

Sarah updated the team on the Gates Foundation Q1 report, submitted Feb 1. Amanda Chen (program officer) responded positively, particularly about the enrollment numbers and market engagement strategy. She mentioned a possible site visit in April — no date confirmed yet. Sarah will follow up to nail down timing so we can prepare.

James reported that the University of Nairobi ethics committee renewal is pending. He submitted Jan 30 and expects approval by end of February. No issues anticipated — this is a routine annual renewal with no protocol changes.

Faith raised the question of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics quarterly update. The last briefing was Jan 15. The next one should be in April, ideally timed with the Gates visit if possible so Sarah only needs to travel once. James offered to present the qualitative findings at the KNBS briefing to add depth beyond the quantitative enrollment numbers.

Lisa flagged that the IPA Kenya contract renewal went through. Her position is secure through Dec 2026. She also noted that IPA's regional director (Michael Torres) will be in Nairobi in March and wants to visit the field sites. Lisa will coordinate.

**Action items from this discussion:**
- Sarah to follow up with Amanda Chen on April site visit timing
- James to coordinate with KNBS for April briefing
- Lisa to schedule Michael Torres field visit (March)
- Faith to assess Gikomba Market situation before Feb 17 screening launch

### Meeting: Nairobi Digital Futures — Midline Design Working Session
Date: 2026-02-05 (Wednesday), 2:00 PM EAT
Participants: Sarah Okonkwo, James Mwangi, Priya Sharma (via Zoom)
Duration: 42 minutes
Source: Granola transcript

*Note: This summary was generated from a meeting transcript by Claude Code. It captures key discussions and decisions but may not reflect every comment or nuance. Team members should flag any corrections.*

#### 1. Baseline Data Review for Midline Planning

Sarah opened with baseline summary statistics from Cohort 1. Key findings relevant to midline design:

- **Balance check:** Treatment and control groups well-balanced on all 14 baseline covariates. Largest normalized difference is 0.08 SD (household income). No concerns.
- **Income and savings measures:** As noted above, direct self-report items on borrowing and savings had 65-78% response rates. Non-sensitive items averaged 96%. The gap confirms measurement concerns.
- **Financial capability scores:** The adapted FINDEX assessment classified 31% of the sample as low-capability, 45% as moderate, and 24% as high. This distribution is close to what we expected based on the pilot data from 2024.
- **Attrition concern:** 6 participants (1.6%) unreachable at the 4-week check-in. All in control group. Lisa is following up with market association contacts. Not yet concerning but worth monitoring.

#### 2. List Experiment Technical Design

Priya presented three design options for the list experiments. After discussion, the group settled on the **double list** approach — each respondent sees both a short list (3 items) and a long list (4 items, one sensitive), randomly assigned to which list is short vs. long. This approach:

- Reduces floor/ceiling effects
- Allows internal consistency checks
- Adds minimal time vs. single list

Priya estimated programming time: 2 weeks in SurveyCTO, including randomization logic and built-in quality checks. The pilot on Feb 24-28 will test comprehension, timing, and enumerator comfort.

#### 3. Endorsement Experiment Alternative

James raised endorsement experiments as an alternative for the informal lending item specifically. Rather than asking about own borrowing, the endorsement experiment asks about support for policies or organizations associated with informal lending regulation. The idea: the program may shift attitudes toward formal financial services even if participants won't report their own borrowing behavior.

Sarah liked the idea conceptually but was concerned about interpretation — endorsement experiments measure attitudes, not behavior, and our primary outcomes are behavioral. The group agreed to include one endorsement experiment item on attitudes toward formal vs. informal financial services as a secondary outcome but not replace the list experiment.

**Decision:** Primary sensitive measurement via list experiments. Add one endorsement experiment item on financial service attitudes as secondary outcome. Priya to program both.
