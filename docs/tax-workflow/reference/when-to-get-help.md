# When to Stop and Call a Professional

This page exists because the most important skill in tax preparation is knowing when you're out of your depth. AI tools make it easier to organize documents and compile data. They do not make complex tax situations simpler.

## The Decision Framework

**Self-filing is reasonable when:**

- Your income sources are domestic and documented on W-2s and 1099s
- Your deductions are straightforward (mortgage interest, charitable giving, state/local taxes)
- You file Schedule C for consulting income but the amounts are modest and the expenses are clear
- You've filed a similar return in prior years without issues
- You're comfortable verifying every number against source documents

**Hire a professional when any of these apply:**

| Situation | Why it needs a professional |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Foreign income (consulting, fellowships, or employment abroad) | Treaty benefits, foreign tax credits, and FEIE elections have complex interactions |
| Foreign bank accounts (>$10,000 aggregate at any point) | FBAR reporting carries severe penalties for errors |
| Rental property | Depreciation schedules, passive activity rules, and loss limitations |
| K-1 partnership income | Partnership allocations, basis tracking, at-risk rules |
| Stock options (ISOs or NSOs) | AMT calculations, exercise timing, basis adjustments |
| Cryptocurrency beyond basic buy/sell | DeFi, staking, airdrops, and cross-chain transactions have unsettled tax treatment |
| Major life events (marriage, divorce, inheritance, home sale) | One-time situations where getting it wrong is expensive |
| Prior-year amendments or IRS correspondence | Responding to the IRS requires specific procedural knowledge |
| First year with significantly increased income | Higher brackets introduce phase-outs and limitations you haven't encountered before |

## The Academic-Specific Cases

Academics have tax situations that look simple but aren't:

### Sabbatical in another country
If you spent your sabbatical abroad and received your regular salary, you may have foreign-sourced income. Whether it's taxable in the host country depends on tax treaties. Whether you can exclude or credit it depends on your specific circumstances. This is not a DIY situation.

### Visiting appointments at foreign institutions
Even a short visiting appointment with local compensation creates foreign income reporting obligations. The host institution may have withheld foreign taxes. You may be eligible for treaty benefits. Get professional help.

### Grant funding with international components
If your grant funds fieldwork or collaborators in other countries, the payment flows can create reporting obligations. The university typically handles grant accounting, but any direct payments you receive may need special treatment.

### Textbook royalties with foreign publishers
Foreign-source royalty income may have had foreign taxes withheld at the source. The 1099 from your US publisher is straightforward; the royalty statement from a foreign publisher is not.

### Moving for a new position
Moving expenses are no longer deductible federally (since 2018), but some states still allow the deduction. If your new employer provided a relocation package, the tax treatment of reimbursements and direct payments differs. If you moved between states, you may owe partial-year returns in both states.

## How to Use AI Tools When You Have a Professional

Having a CPA doesn't mean AI tools have no value. The workflow described in this case study helps in two ways:

### 1. Reduce billable hours

CPAs charge by the hour. The more organized your materials are when you hand them over, the less time they spend on preparation. The document collection skill produces a completeness checklist. The compilation skills produce organized spreadsheets. The three-year comparison provides context your CPA would otherwise have to reconstruct.

**What to hand your CPA:**

- Complete document folder with consistent naming
- Completeness checklist showing what's included and what's missing
- Schedule C spreadsheet (if applicable) as a draft for their review
- Charitable contribution summary
- Medical expense summary (if above threshold)
- Three-year comparison printout
- A list of questions or situations you want them to address

### 2. Ask better questions

The compilation and review process surfaces questions you didn't know you had. "Why did my effective tax rate increase when my income only went up 3%?" "Should this consulting income be on Schedule C or reported differently?" Having organized data lets you have a more productive conversation with your CPA.

## Finding a Tax Professional

**What to look for:**

| Credential | What it means | Best for |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **CPA** (Certified Public Accountant) | Licensed, regulated, continuing education required | Complex returns, audit representation |
| **EA** (Enrolled Agent) | IRS-licensed, specializes in tax | Tax-specific issues, IRS representation |
| **Tax attorney** | Law degree + tax specialization | Legal disputes, estate planning, IRS controversies |

**For professionals with side income:** Look for someone who handles:

- Schedule C consulting or freelance income
- RSU / stock option taxation (if applicable)
- Investment income and capital gains
- Multi-state filing (if you've moved or have income in multiple states)

**Red flags:**

- Guarantees a specific refund amount before seeing your documents
- Charges based on refund size (percentage-based fees)
- Discourages you from reviewing the return before filing
- Can't explain why specific items are handled a certain way

## The Priya Test

[Priya Chatterjee](../before-you-start/meet-the-personas.md) — our full professor persona — is the escalation case. Her return includes foreign consulting income, rental property, a K-1 partnership, and FBAR reporting. No amount of AI-assisted organization makes self-filing appropriate for her situation.

But Priya still benefits from the workflow. Her CPA typically needs two meetings: one to review materials and ask questions, one to review the draft return. With organized materials from the AI workflow, the first meeting is shorter and more focused. Last year's CPA bill was lower than expected because Priya handed over a complete, organized package.

**The honest version of the value proposition:** AI tools don't replace tax expertise. They replace tax busywork. For simple returns, that busywork is all there is — so AI handles most of the work. For complex returns, the busywork is the smaller part — but eliminating it still saves time and money.

## Cost Comparison

A rough framework for thinking about professional costs vs. self-filing:

| Situation | Self-file cost | Professional cost | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Elena (simple) | $0-50 (free/cheap software) | $200-400 | Self-file |
| James (medium) | $30-80 (paid software tier) | $500-1,200 | Self-file is reasonable with care |
| Priya (complex) | — | $1,500-4,000 | Hire a professional |

These ranges are approximate and vary by location, preparer, and specific complexity. The key insight: for medium-complexity returns like James's, the choice between self-filing and hiring a professional is genuinely close. The AI workflow tips the balance toward self-filing by reducing error risk — but only if you actually use the verification steps.
