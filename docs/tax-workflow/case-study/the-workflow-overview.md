## Stage 1: Document Collection

**The problem:** Tax documents arrive over 6-8 weeks from dozens of sources. Employers, banks, brokerages, mortgage companies, universities, consulting clients. Some arrive by email. Some require portal logins. Some arrive by mail. Every year, something gets missed.

**What the skill does:**

1. **Searches Gmail** for tax-related emails (W-2, 1099, 1098, payment confirmations)
2. **Downloads attachments** with your approval, renaming them consistently
3. **Extracts key figures** from each document (income amounts, withholding, interest paid)
4. **Updates a tracking checklist** — what's collected, what's still missing, what requires a portal login
5. **Runs income reconciliation** — compares this year's payers against last year to catch missing 1099s

**What it doesn't do:** Log into financial portals (Vanguard, Bank of America, Coinbase). Those require browser authentication. The skill reminds you with direct URLs.

**Designed to run repeatedly.** You run it in mid-January when the first documents arrive, again in late January, again in early February. Each run is additive — it finds new documents and skips what's already collected.

## Stage 2: Compilation

**The problem:** Once documents are collected, you need to turn them into organized data for tax software entry. Schedule C requires categorized business expenses. Charitable contributions are tracked in a spreadsheet that needs exporting. Medical expenses are buried in credit card statements. Each compilation task has its own data source and its own quirks.

**What the skill does:**

The compilation skill has sub-commands for different tax components:

| Sub-command | What it builds | Data sources |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| `schedule-c` | Schedule C profit & loss spreadsheet | Guided interview + extracted 1099 income |
| `charitable` | Charitable contribution summary | Google Sheets export |
| `medical` | Medical expense compilation | Credit card CSV + email search for tuition |
| `review` | Three-year return comparison | Current draft + two prior-year PDFs |

**Schedule C is a guided interview, not automated extraction.** The skill walks you through each IRS expense category, shows what you claimed last year, prompts for this year's entries, handles foreign currency conversion, and generates a formatted spreadsheet. You provide the knowledge; the skill provides the structure.

**The threshold gate for medical expenses:** Before spending an hour processing credit card transactions, the skill estimates whether your medical expenses will exceed the 7.5% AGI threshold. It uses W-2 wages plus known 1099 income as a rough AGI proxy — not the final AGI, which isn't known until the return is complete. If the estimate suggests you're well below the threshold, the skill tells you and offers to skip — saving time on a deduction that won't apply.

    > Consulting engagement, Denver, $XXX
    > done
    ```

## Stage 3: Three-Year Review

**The problem:** Errors hide in plain sight when you only look at one year. A deduction that dropped by half. Income that appeared last year but not this year. An effective tax rate that shifted for no obvious reason.

**What the skill does:**

1. Reads the current return draft and two prior-year returns (PDFs)
2. Extracts key figures: wages, Schedule C net, capital gains, AGI, itemized deductions, total tax, effective rate
3. Displays a side-by-side comparison with year-over-year changes
4. **Flags anomalies:** any line item with >15% change, sign reversals (profit to loss), large refund patterns suggesting over-withholding

    Capital Gains             $X,XXX     $X,XXX     $X,XXX    +X.X%
    AGI                      $XXX,XXX   $XXX,XXX   $XXX,XXX   +X.X%

    Total Tax                $XXX,XXX   $XXX,XXX   $XXX,XXX   +X.X%
    Effective Rate             XX.X%      XX.X%      XX.X%

    FLAGS:
      !! Schedule C changed from profit to loss — verify expense entries
      !! Itemized deductions dropped 22% — check charitable, medical

    ```

**This is the single highest-value step.** It caught real errors in the actual workflow this case study is based on. More on this in [What AI Got Wrong](what-ai-got-wrong.md).

## Stage 4: Manual Entry and Filing

**This stage is not AI-assisted.** The generated spreadsheets and summaries are reference material for entering data into tax software (FreeTaxUSA, TurboTax, H&R Block, etc.).

The compilation skill includes "entry guides" — mapping each compiled figure to the specific field in the tax software. But the human types the numbers and clicks submit.

**Why not automate this step?** Two reasons:

1. **No tax software has a reliable import API** for the kind of data this workflow produces. Some accept CSV imports for specific forms, but the coverage is spotty and error-prone.
2. **Manual entry is the final verification layer.** Typing each number forces you to look at it one more time. This is a feature, not a limitation.

## Where Human Judgment Is Required

Every stage has mandatory human review points. These are not optional guardrails — they are load-bearing parts of the workflow.

| Stage | Human review point | Why it can't be automated |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Collection | Approve each download | Deduplication heuristics aren't perfect |
| Collection | Verify extracted amounts | PDF extraction fails on scanned documents |
| Schedule C | Classify each expense | Only you know which trips were for consulting vs. reimbursed by your employer |
| Medical | Review uncertain vendors | "Wellness" expenses have ambiguous medical qualification |
| Review | Investigate flagged anomalies | A flag means "look at this," not "this is wrong" |
| Filing | Enter all figures manually | Final verification layer |

## Time Savings (Realistic)

Based on the actual workflow this case study describes, for someone with James's complexity level:

| Task | Without AI | With AI | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Document collection | 3-4 hours | 1 hour | Multiple sessions over 6 weeks |
| Schedule C compilation | 3-4 hours | 1.5 hours | Guided interview is faster than spreadsheet from scratch |
| Charitable export | 30 min | 5 min | One command vs. manual spreadsheet export |
| Medical compilation | 2-3 hours | 1 hour | Threshold check saves time when deduction doesn't apply |
| Three-year review | Not done | 30 min | Most people skip this entirely — the AI makes it feasible |
| Tax software entry | 2 hours | 2 hours | Same either way |
| **Total** | **~12 hours** | **~6 hours** | **~50% reduction** |

The hours saved are real but not the main value. The main value is **error reduction** and the three-year review, which most people never do manually.

!!! info "Federal only"
    This case study covers **federal tax filing only**. State returns add their own complexity — especially if you earned income in multiple states. See [When to Get Help](../reference/when-to-get-help.md) for guidance on multi-state filing.
