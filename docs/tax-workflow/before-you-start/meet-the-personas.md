# Meet the Personas

All examples in this case study use three fictional characters. Their tax situations are designed to illustrate different complexity levels — from a PhD student's first real return to a senior professor who needs a CPA. No real dollar amounts, SSNs, or identifying details appear anywhere in these pages.

## Elena Vasquez — PhD Candidate, Year 4

<div class="narrative-block" markdown>

**University:** Fictional Midwestern R1

**Income:**

- Stipend via W-2 (~$34,000)
- One summer RA position at an outside org (1099-NEC, ~$4,200)
- Conference travel reimbursements (not taxable)

**Deductions:** Standard deduction. Student loan interest.

**Filing complexity:** Low. Has never filed beyond a basic return with TurboTax.

</div>

**Why Elena matters for this case study:** Even a simple return benefits from organized document collection. Elena gets her W-2 from the university payroll portal, but the 1099-NEC from the summer position arrives by email in late January and she almost misses it every year. The document-collection pattern catches this automatically.

**Elena's key question:** *"Is it worth setting this up for a return I can do in 30 minutes?"*

**The answer:** The collection skill takes 15 minutes to set up once. The compilation skill is overkill for Elena. But the collection skill's value — making sure nothing is missing — pays off even for simple returns, especially as her income sources multiply in later career stages.

## James Okafor — Operations Director, Mid-Career

<div class="narrative-block" markdown>

**Employer:** Meridian Logistics (fictional mid-size company)

**Income:**

- Company salary (W-2)
- Side consulting for two clients (1099-NEC)
- Investment accounts (1099-DIV, 1099-B)
- RSU vests from a prior employer (1099-B, supplemental)

**Deductions:** Itemized. Mortgage interest (1098), charitable giving, childcare FSA, home office (simplified method) for consulting work. Files Schedule C for consulting income.

**Filing complexity:** Medium. Has done his own taxes for years using FreeTaxUSA, but spends a full weekend on it and worries he's missing deductions.

</div>

**Why James matters:** He is the core case study. Most of the workflow content revolves around James's tax situation because it hits the sweet spot: complex enough to benefit from AI organization, simple enough to self-file responsibly. His "main job plus side consulting" pattern is one of the most common paths into tax complexity.

**James's key challenges:**

- **Document scatter:** W-2 from his company's HR portal, two 1099-NECs from consulting clients arriving by email, 1099-DIV and 1099-B from his brokerage, mortgage 1098, charitable donations tracked in a Google Sheet, medical expenses on credit card statements
- **Schedule C anxiety:** Is his home office deduction correct? Is he categorizing consulting expenses right? How does his Schedule C compare to last year?
- **Time cost:** The actual tax software entry takes 2 hours. The document gathering, organizing, and double-checking takes 8-10 hours spread across several weekends

**What the workflow does for James:** Cuts the 8-10 hours of prep to roughly 3-4 hours. The collection skill finds and downloads documents automatically. The compilation skill builds his Schedule C spreadsheet through a guided interview and generates the charitable contribution export. The review skill compares his return against two prior years and flags anomalies.

## Priya Chatterjee — Full Professor, Department Chair

<div class="narrative-block" markdown>

**University:** Fictional state university system

**Income:**

- University salary (W-2)
- Consulting in three countries (1099-NEC + foreign income)
- Rental property income (Schedule E)
- K-1 from a textbook partnership
- Complex investment portfolio (1099-B, 1099-DIV with foreign tax credits)
- Foreign bank account (FBAR reporting required)

**Deductions:** Itemized with significant complexity. Foreign tax credits. Rental property depreciation. Partnership losses.

**Filing complexity:** High. **Requires a CPA.** Self-filing would be irresponsible.

</div>

**Why Priya matters:** She represents the escalation case — where AI tools are genuinely useful for *organizing* documents and *preparing* materials for a professional, but where self-filing is a mistake.

**What the workflow does for Priya:** The collection skill still helps — it gathers scattered documents and produces a completeness dashboard that Priya can hand to her CPA. The compilation skill can build the charitable and medical expense summaries. But Schedule C with foreign income, the rental property, the K-1, and the FBAR all require professional preparation.

**Priya's key lesson:** AI doesn't replace expertise. It replaces busywork. Priya's CPA charges by the hour. Handing over an organized folder with a completeness checklist, pre-compiled deduction spreadsheets, and a three-year comparison saves the CPA time — which saves Priya money.
