# Quickstart: Your First 5 Minutes

**Goal:** Paste one prompt into Claude (or ChatGPT) and get something immediately useful. No setup required.

## What You'll Do

You're going to give an AI chatbot a structured prompt that helps it organize a messy, real-world task. This takes about 5 minutes and demonstrates two key principles:

1. **Structured prompts get dramatically better results** than casual questions
2. **Saved context** (telling the AI about you once) eliminates repetitive setup

---

## Step 1: Pick Your Tool

You need one of these (free tiers work fine):

- [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) (OpenAI)

Open whichever you have. If you have both, use Claude.

## Step 2: Copy and Paste This Prompt

Copy the entire block below and paste it into your chat:

```text
I'd like your help organizing my professional development and learning goals
for the next 3 months. I'll describe my situation, and I want you to help me
create a structured, actionable plan.

## My context
- Role: [FILL IN: your job title or role, e.g., "assistant professor of economics",
  "program manager at an NGO", "PhD student in political science"]
- Biggest time sinks: [FILL IN: 2-3 things that eat your time, e.g., "email,
  grant reporting, coordinating with field teams"]
- Skills I want to develop: [FILL IN: 1-3 things, e.g., "better data visualization,
  AI tools for research, project management"]
- Time available: [FILL IN: roughly how many hours/week you can dedicate,
  e.g., "3-5 hours per week"]

## What I want
Create a 3-month learning plan with:
1. Monthly themes (what to focus on each month)
2. Weekly commitments (specific, small actions — not vague goals)
3. Quick wins (things I can do this week that take <30 minutes each)
4. Resources (specific tools, courses, or readings — not generic suggestions)

Be concrete and realistic. I'd rather have a plan I'll actually follow than an
ambitious one I'll abandon. If something I listed isn't realistic in the time
available, tell me directly and suggest what to cut.
```

**Fill in the bracketed sections** with your own information, then send it.

## Step 3: See the Difference

Compare this to what you'd get if you just asked: *"Help me make a professional development plan."*

The structured version works better because it:

- **Gives context** so the AI doesn't waste time on generic advice
- **Specifies the output format** so you get something actionable, not an essay
- **Sets constraints** (time available, "be realistic") so the result fits your life
- **Invites pushback** ("tell me directly") so the AI doesn't just agree with everything

## What to Do With the Result

The plan you get isn't the point. The *process* is the point. You just learned that:

1. **Five minutes of prompt structure** transforms a vague request into a useful output
2. **Context about you** (role, constraints, goals) is what makes AI responses personal rather than generic
3. **Explicit output format** (monthly themes, weekly commitments) controls what you get back

These three principles — structure, context, and format — apply to every AI interaction. They're the foundation of everything else on this site.
