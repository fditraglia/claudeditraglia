# Build Your Own

!!! warning "Early Preview — Coming Soon"
    This section is under active development. The pages below have initial content, with more detail coming in the weeks after launch. Current as of February 2026.

**How to create your own skills, agents, and self-improving workflows.**

The Essentials taught you to use AI tools. The Toolkit gave you a configured system. This path teaches you to *build* — to create custom tools that solve your specific problems and a system that gets better the more you use it.

| **[Building Skills](building-skills.md)** | How to create custom slash commands from scratch. The skill development lifecycle. | Initial content |
| **[Agents vs Skills](agents-vs-skills.md)** | When to use a subagent vs. a skill. Architecture decisions for different workflows. | Initial content |
| **[Patterns](patterns.md)** | Reusable design patterns for skills and workflows. Quality checklist. | Initial content |

## The Core Idea

The most valuable thing about this system isn't any individual skill or configuration. It's the *meta-skill* of continuous improvement:

1. **Notice friction** — Where do you do the same thing repeatedly? Where do you copy-paste between tools? Where do you lose context between sessions?
2. **Build a solution** — Create a skill or configure a workflow that handles it.
3. **Critique and iterate** — Use Claude to review and improve what you built. (Yes, use the AI to improve the AI tools.)
4. **Share what works** — Publish skills that might help others. Learn from what others share.

This cycle is what turns a collection of tools into a system that compounds over time. Every skill you build makes the next one easier to build. Every pattern you learn applies to the next problem.

## Prerequisites

You should have:

- A working Claude Code installation ([Install guides](../toolkit/install-mac.md))
- A configured CLAUDE.md file ([Setup guide](../toolkit/claude-md.md))
- Some experience using existing skills ([Skill Library](../toolkit/skill-library.md))
- Comfort reading and editing markdown files

You don't need to know how to code. Skills are written in markdown (structured text), not a programming language.
