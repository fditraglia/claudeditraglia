# MIGRATION NOTE: This template uses weighted OKR format with progress scores.
# If upgrading from the simpler flat format (goals.professional, goals.system, etc.),

  # Add more objectives as needed. Common categories:
  # - Team Effectiveness (RA management, delegation, onboarding)
  # - Teaching & Advising (courses, student supervision)
  # - System Building (AI tools, workflows, automation)
  #
  # Tips:
  # - 3-5 objectives is a good range. More becomes hard to track.
  # - Weights should reflect actual priority, not aspiration.
  # - Set status: dormant for objectives not active this quarter.
  # - Mark at_risk: true when a key_result falls behind expected pace.

upcoming_deadlines:
  - date: "2026-03-15"
    description: "Example: Grant report due to Foundation X"
    objective: grant-management

  - date: "2026-03-31"
    description: "Example: Paper revision due to Journal Y"
    objective: research-output

  # Add your real deadlines here. /goals-review surfaces these
  # in the dashboard view and /checkin references them for priorities.
